## Implementation Priority

### ~~HIGH Priority~~ ✅ COMPLETED
1. ~~**ADDS/SUBS**~~ ✅ - Arithmetic with flag updates, very common
2. ~~**MADD**~~ ✅ - Multiply-add, frequently used for array indexing

### MEDIUM Priority (Important for completeness)
1. **LDNP/STNP** - Non-temporal loads/stores
2. **LDXR/STXR** - Exclusive loads/stores for atomics
3. **LDURB/LDURH/STURB/STURH** - Unscaled byte/halfword loads/stores
4. ~~**LDUR/STUR**~~ ✅ - Unscaled word/dword loads/stores
5. ~~**LDRSB/LDRSH**~~ ✅ - Sign-extending loads
6. ~~**CSINC**~~ ✅ - Conditional increment
7. ~~**ANDS**~~ ✅ - AND with flags
8. ~~**SBFM/UBFM**~~ ✅ - Bitfield operations

### LOW Priority (Nice to have)
1. **FP instructions** - Floating-point operations
2. **LDADD** - Atomic operations
3. **MOVI** - SIMD move immediate
4. ~~**BFM**~~ ✅ - General bitfield move
5. **PACGA** - Specialized PAC instruction
6. **DC ZVA** - Cache operations

## Summary

- **Total instructions in is_linear_inst()**: 102
- **Currently supported**: ~75 (74%)
- **~~Missing critical~~**: ~~4~~ ✅ 0 - All critical instructions now implemented!
- **Missing important**: ~10 (significant reduction)
- **Missing nice-to-have**: ~17

The emulator now has **excellent coverage** of the most critical instructions! All HIGH priority instructions (ADDS/SUBS variants, MADD) have been implemented, along with many important MEDIUM priority items including bitfield operations, conditional select increment, and unscaled memory operations.
